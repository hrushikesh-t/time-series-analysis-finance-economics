# Time Series Analysis of Financial and Economic Data
This project applies classical time series analysis techniques to real-world financial and economic datasets. 
ARMA and SARIMA models are used to analyze and forecast BlackRock (BLK) stock returns and the unemployment rate in California, 
demonstrating how statistical modeling supports risk assessment and economic decision-making.
## Project Overview
The project analyzes two different types of time series data to highlight the contrast between 
non-seasonal financial data and seasonal economic data. Each dataset is modeled using the 
Box–Jenkins methodology, including identification, estimation, diagnostic checking, and forecasting.
